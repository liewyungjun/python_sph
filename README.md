## Tools

mapmaker.py creates and saves maps in matplotlib using mouse clicks
collisionTestSim.py illustrates collision vectors

## Issues
* 3D implementation is WIP
* Simultaenous collisions with multiple obstacle edges (i.e. corners) are not fully handled



This implementation is inspired by https://github.com/SebLague/Fluid-Sim
